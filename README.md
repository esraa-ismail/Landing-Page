# Landing-Page
after decleared the global #Variables i started with coding the nav bar , i coded it by a few steps :
1 - I decleard a function and call it #creatNav .
2 - I used for loop to make a number from #li equal to  the number of rhe section 
3 - I made it have the same name by taking the #h2 of all sections by decleared a #heading & #newNaveName variable
4 -  I tied the links with the sections by decleard the #Id in #newNaveId and write it in href of the <a> tag which i wrote it
 when  i  insert the content to the new <li> .
 
 ___________________
 
 then i go to code the next requirement (make the active section have class ('your-active-class')) :
 1- I used #addEventListner with type #scroll and passing a functino on it (listenr)
  
 2 - decleared a function and call it makeActive.
 3- in the function I used for loop to caleculat the distance between every section and the top , and i orederd when the section 
 have no distance between itt and the top add ('your-active-class') to it , and bytheway take a look on the navbar . 
 if the link(a li) has the same heading with the active section make it active too and add class ('active-li') to it .
 
 
 _____________________
 in the last I coded to make a scroll button , which i use in the first function tom make it hide whe we on the top of the page .
 and make it visible when we in the bottom of the page .
 and i use addEventListner with click type , and passed a function in it to scroll the window to top when we click on the button
